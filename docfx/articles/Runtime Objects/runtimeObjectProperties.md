# Runtime Object Properties

Each type of `RuntimeObject` is specially designed for a specific purpose but regardless of whichever Runtime Object you choose to create, all instances will feature an exposed description field for you to comment on what the purpose of this object is. Like with commenting your code, this helps your collaborators understand how it is supposed to interact with the rest of your code

It's not necessary to fill this in but doing so will help you and your team in the long run.
