# Creating Runtime Objects

With Scriptable Framework added to your Unity project, you can get started right away by following these steps:

1. Create a folder called `Resources` anywhere in your project (you can have multiple Resources folders throughout your project)
2. Navigate into the new folder
3. Right click inside the project view and go to "Create > Runtime Objects"

**Not doing so will create errors and cause your objects to behave in unexpected ways**

This will open up a list of all the ScriptableObject types available to you, including any custom object types you may have made.
