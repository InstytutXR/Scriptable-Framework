# Scriptable Framework - Manual

The **Scriptable Framework** is a framework used to create a foundation for modular and testable Unity development. (Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/pablothedolphin/Scriptable-Framework))

Modular code is vital to writing reusable and digestable pieces of functionality which can then be distributed between projects. With a large enough library of modular packages, you'll be able to construct new or bespoke applications by just reusing existing modules as building blocks and use the **Scriptable Framework** as the glue which connects it all together.

This manual will explain how to use the **Scriptable Framework** by breaking it down to it's components and document the usecases of each of them.
