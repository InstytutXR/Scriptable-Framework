# Scriptable Framework - Manual

The **Scriptable Framework** is a framework used to create a foundation for modular and testable Unity development. 

Modular code is vital to writing reusable and digestable pieces of functionality which can then be distributed between projects. With a large enough library of modular packages, you'll be able to construct new or bespoke applications by just reusing existing modules as building blocks and use the **Scriptable Framework** as the glue which connects it all together.
